#TODO
## Check if models already downloaded and then disable in choice list
## Warn how much free space available and how much the download will take
## Show % of DL for each file and for all process
## Add more controlnet models
## Add pix2pix, inpainting etc -> models/Stable-diffusion
## Add shell to gdown for personal models
